<p>Achieving reproducibility in scientific research is a laudable goal, however this has been difficult to achieve. While data and data analysis play a central role in many scientific domains, most papers specify their methods and data only informally and omit important supplemental material. High quality journals have responded to this issue by making reproducibility a requirement for publication. Understanding the challenges to reproducibility and combating them with tools and best practices is therefore of cross-disciplinary relevance.</p>

<p><a href="http://msdse.org/" >The Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment</a> at NYU is pleased to announce a symposium on reproducibility that will be held on May 3, 2016.</p>

<p>At the NYU Reproducibility Symposium, we will showcase tools to help make the reproducibility process easy along with case studies showing how creating reproducible experiments has helped other research groups. The symposium will consist of keynotes and tutorial sessions in the morning, followed by discussions of research topics in reproducibility and hands-on sessions in the afternoon.</p>
