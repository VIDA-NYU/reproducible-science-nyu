    <a href="https://github.com/gems-uff/noworkflow" target="_blank">noWorkflow</a> is a non-intrusive tool that doesn't require researchers to change the way in which they work, but instead allows them to capture a variety of provenance information and utilize the analyses it supports, including graph-based visualization, differencing over provenance trails, and inference queries. Another goal of this project is to allow researchers to avoid using naming conventions to store files originated in previous executions. Currently, when this is not done, the result and intermediate files are overwritten by every new execution of the pipeline.

noWorkflow supports infrastructure to run scientific experiments without a scientific workflow management system. By levering Software Engineering techniques (such as abstract syntax tree analysis, reflection, and profiling), noWorkflow can collect different types of provenance, including detailed information about underlying libraries. noWorkflow was developed in Python and is currently able to capture the provenance of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.
