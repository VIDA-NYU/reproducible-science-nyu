<p>The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology launched in 2013 as an ambitious effort to scrutinize key findings in 50 cancer papers published in Nature, Science, Cell and other high-impact journals. It aims to determine what fraction of influential cancer biology studies are probably sound â€” a pressing question for the field.

That was widely reported, but Amgen has not identified the studies involved.</p>
