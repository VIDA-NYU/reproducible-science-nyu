<p>SIGMOD Reproducibility has three goals: Highlight the impact of database research papers; Enable easy dissemination of research results; Enable easy sharing of code and experimentation set-ups. In short, the goal is to assist in building culture where sharing results, code, and scripts of database research is the norm rather than the exception. The challenge is to do this efficiently, which means building technical expertise on how to do better research via creating repeatable and shareable research. The SIGMOD Reproducibility Committee is here to help you with this.</p>
