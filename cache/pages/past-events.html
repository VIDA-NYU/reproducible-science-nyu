<div id="repro"><b><a href="/2016-repro-symposium">New York University Reproducibility Symposium 2016</a></b></div>
May 3, 2016 | The Center for Urban Science + Progress, 1 MetroTech Center, 19th Floor, Brooklyn, NY 11201

Achieving reproducibility in scientific research is a laudable goal, however this has been difficult to achieve. While data and data analysis play a central role in many scientific domains, most papers specify their methods and data only informally and omit important supplemental material. High quality journals have responded to this issue by making reproducibility a requirement for publication. Understanding the challenges to reproducibility and combating them with tools and best practices is therefore of cross-disciplinary relevance.

<a href="http://msdse.org/" target="_blank">The Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment</a> at NYU is pleased to announce a symposium on reproducibility that will be held on May 3, 2016.

At the NYU Reproducibility Symposium, we will showcase tools to help make the reproducibility process easy along with case studies showing how creating reproducible experiments has helped other research groups. The symposium will consist of keynotes and tutorial sessions in the morning, followed by discussions of research topics in reproducibility and hands-on sessions in the afternoon. <a href="/2016-repro-symposium">Read more.</a>

<div id="aGit2"><b><a href="http://nyu.libcal.com/event/2550255" target="_blank">Advanced Git and GitHub</a></b></div>
April 28, 2016 | Bobst Library, New York University, New York, New York

Modern research involving data analysis increasingly uses programming to increase efficiency and allow for more effective use of data.As code becomes a more and more essential part of research activities, we need to treat it with the same care that we treat other research products. The first step towards more maintainable software development and data analysis is using version control on all research and analysis code. Git is a popular tool for tracking individual and collaborative development of code.

This workshop takes a look at advanced usage and collaboration using Git and GitHub, including: the concept of branches, and how to manipulate them with merge and rebases, forks and pull requests, and we'll even rewrite history using rebase, and possible workflows.

To get the full benefits of this session, you should have attended the introductory Git and GitHub workshop, or already have familiarity with basic version control using Git (the commands "add", "commit", "log", "diff", "status"), working with remotes ("git pull" and "git push") and handling merge conflicts. Please bring your own laptop with Git installed.

Bobst Library, New York University, New York, New York

Have you heard about the reproducibility crisis in science (ex. in <a href="http://www.aaas.org/news/concerns-about-non-reproducible-data-mount-some-solutions-take-shape">N</a><a href="http://www.nature.com/news/over-half-of-psychology-studies-fail-reproducibility-test-1.18248">ature</a> and <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21588057-scientists-think-science-self-correcting-alarming-degree-it-not-trouble">Economist</a>)? Do you worry about false positive results? Or ever wondered how you could increase the reproducibility of your own work? Please join us for a workshop, hosted by <a href="http://cos.io/">the Center for Open Science</a>, to learn easy, practical steps to increase the reproducibility of your work. The workshop will be hands-on. Using example studies, attendees will actively participate in creating a reproducible project from start to finish. Attendees will need to bring their own laptop in order to fully participate.
<ul>
	<li>Topics we'll cover include:
<ul>
	<li>project documentation</li>
	<li>version control</li>
	<li>pre-analysis plans</li>
	<li>open source tools like the COS's <a href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Framework</a> to easily implement these concepts in a scientific workflow</li>

Bobst Library, New York University, New York, New York

Modern research involving data analysis increasingly uses programming to increase efficiency and allow for more effective use of data.As code becomes a more and more essential part of research activities, we need to treat it with the same care that we treat other research products. The first step towards more maintainable software development and data analysis is using version control on all research and analysis code. Git is a popular tool for tracking individual and collaborative development of code.

This workshop introduces the basic concepts of Git version control. Whether you're new to version control or just need an explanation of Git and GitHub, this two hour tutorial will help you understand the concepts of distributed version control. Get to know basic Git concepts and GitHub workflows through step-by-step lessons. We'll even rewrite a bit of history, and touch on how to undo (almost) anything with Git. This is a class for users who are comfortable with a command-line interface. Version control usually facilitates:
<ul>
	<li>easy backup</li>
	<li>easy retrieval of specific revisions</li>
	<li>documentation (who did what when and why?)</li>
	<li>documentation (how do I do ...?)</li>
	<li>easy synchronization (staying up-to-date, integrating changes between multiple developers/machines)</li>
	<li>finding the changes introducing regressions (AKA bugs) efficiently</li>
</ul>

<div id="w1"><b> Workshop on Reproducibility in Science: May 1, 2013 </b></div>
Description

While data and data analysis have become central in many scientific domains, most computational experiments and analyses are specified only informally in papers, where results are briefly described in figure captions; the code and scripts that produced the results are seldom available. Because important scientific discoveries are often the result of sequences of smaller, less significant steps, the ability to publish results that are fully documented and reproducible is necessary for advancing science. While concern about repeatability and generalizability cuts across virtually all natural, computational, and social science fields, no single field has identified this concern as a target of a research effort.

With a view towards a broader adoption of reproducibility and as a step towards better understanding the reproducibility requirements and challenges, this workshop will bring together scientists from different disciplines that work on data-intensive research. Each scientist will give a presentation outlining:
<ul>
	<li>The kinds of experiments carried out in her/his field</li>
	<li>What is reproducible in them?</li>
	<li>Which tools are used?</li>
	<li>Why (or why not) reproducibility would be desirable?</li>
	<li>Existing reproducibility efforts in her/his field, if any?</li>
	<li>What are the existing barriers (if any) to reproducibility?</li>
</ul>
We will then have open discussions on topics including the similarities and differences across domains and how to broaden the adoption of reproducibility.

<b> Workshop on Software Infrastructure for Reproducibility in Science: May 30th-31st, 2013 </b>

Description

While there are a number of tools that support different aspects of reproducibility, because these tools are often targeted to specific domains and there is no coordination in their development, it is hard and sometimes impossible to combine them. As a result, we lack general components that can be mixed and matched to construct end-to-end solutions that are applicable across different domains.

With a view towards a broader adoption of reproducibility in computational science and as a step towards the design and implementation of a unified platform to support the publication of reproducible results, this workshop will bring together developers of reproducibility tools. The participants will present the state-of-the-art in reproducibility tools and we will have discussions on important (and required) features, limitations of existing tools, and how they can be integrated. One of the planned outcomes for the workshop is a blueprint for the unified reproducibility platform.

We also hope this workshop will help catalyze the creation of a cohesive community developers and scientists who will work closely together to build a platform that supports reproducibility across different domains.

The workshop will be held in New York City, and thanks to a grant from the Sloan Foundation, we will be able to cover travel costs for the invited participants.

We will focus on the design of a blueprint for a unified reproducibility framework and discuss models for creating and sustaining a community of developers for reproducibility tools.
<ul>
	<li>9:00 - 10:30 Discussion: What global architecture of tools can we use to enable working researchers capture computations easily, reproduce and vary them on different systems?</li>
	<li>10:30 - 11:00 Coffee break</li>
	<li>11:00 – 12:30 Breakout groups to define the ideal architecture of a reproducibility framework</li>
	<li>Three groups: capture/representation, archival, test/validation</li>
	<li>12:30 – 1:30 Lunch</li>
	<li>1:30 – 3:00 Report from breakouts and discussion on proposed architecture</li>
	<li>3:00 – 3:30 Coffee break</li>
	<li>3:30 – 5:00 Discussion: How to create and sustain a community of developers of reproducibility tools? Work on white paper.</li>
